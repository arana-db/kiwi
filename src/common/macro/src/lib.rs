/// Attribute macro to derive [std::fmt::Debug] for the annotated `Error` type.
///
/// The generated `Debug` implementation will print the error in a stack trace style. E.g.:
/// ```plaintext
/// 0: Foo error, at src/storage/src/error.rs:108:65
/// 1: Root cause, Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
/// ```
///
/// Notes on using this macro:
/// - `#[snafu(display)]` must present on each enum variants,and should not include `location` and `source`.
/// - Only our internal error can be named `source`.All external error should be `error` with an `#[snafu(source)]` annotation.
