# Raft Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the test cases needed for the Kiwi Raft integration once the compilation errors are resolved. The existing test infrastructure in `src/raft/src/integration_tests.rs` provides a good foundation but requires fixes to compile and run.

## Current Test Status

### Existing Test Infrastructure
- **Integration Tests**: `src/raft/src/integration_tests.rs` contains comprehensive test framework
- **Unit Tests**: Individual modules have `#[cfg(test)]` sections with basic unit tests
- **Test Utilities**: `TestCluster` and `TestNode` structures for cluster simulation

### Compilation Issues Preventing Test Execution
- Type mismatches with openraft 0.9.21 API
- Missing dependencies (rand crate)
- Private method access issues
- Incorrect trait implementations

## Required Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (Optional - marked with *)
- **Type Conversion Tests**: Verify serialization/deserialization of Raft types
- **Configuration Parsing**: Test cluster configuration validation
- **Storage Operations**: Test individual storage layer functions
- **State Machine Logic**: Test Redis command processing

### 2. Integration Tests (Optional - marked with *)
- **Three-Node Cluster**: Basic cluster formation and operation
- **Leader Election**: Test leader election process
- **Log Replication**: Verify log entries are replicated correctly
- **Network Partitions**: Test cluster behavior during network splits
- **Node Failures**: Test failover and recovery scenarios
- **Data Consistency**: Verify data remains consistent across nodes

### 3. Performance Tests (Optional - marked with *)
- **Throughput Benchmarks**: Measure operations per second
- **Latency Tests**: Measure response times under load
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and CPU usage
- **Scalability**: Test with different cluster sizes

## Test Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Fix Compilation Issues
1. Resolve openraft API compatibility issues
2. Add missing dependencies (rand, tempfile)
3. Fix trait implementation mismatches
4. Correct type annotations

### Phase 2: Basic Functionality Tests
1. Single node operations
2. Basic cluster formation
3. Simple read/write operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Scenarios
1. Failure recovery tests
2. Network partition handling
3. Performance benchmarks

## Test Infrastructure Requirements

### Dependencies Needed
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
tempfile = "3.0"
tokio-test = "0.4"
```

### Mock Components
- Mock storage engine for isolated testing
- Network simulation for partition testing
- Time control for timeout testing

## Expected Test Coverage

Once implemented, tests should cover:
- ✅ Basic cluster operations
- ✅ Failure scenarios
- ✅ Data consistency
- ✅ Performance characteristics
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Network communication

## Notes

All test subtasks (11.1, 11.2, 11.3) are marked as optional in the task specification, indicating they are not required for the core functionality. The main focus should be on ensuring the existing test infrastructure can compile and run once the underlying Raft implementation is fixed.
